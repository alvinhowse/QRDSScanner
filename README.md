# QR-DS: A better way of storing files on a QR code
QR codes normally store purely ASCII text. They don't usually contain multiple binary files. This scanner allows scanning this brand new QR-DS format I made. Please go to the "Issues" tab and add a new issue, and we'll look into it.

**Important Notice: Please put the QR-DS code right where it can be optimally read during scanning. If you don't, it will result in the camera being constantly on due to it trying to capture another picture. IF insure, use the Camera app and position your code until it is at the centre of the photo.**
